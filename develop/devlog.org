#+title: MayaLucIA Development Log
#+startup: overview

* Open Threads
** TODO [MayaLucIA] <placeholder — describe an active question>

* Decision Log
** <2026-02-08> Devlog structure adopted
   - Context: Need to track development decisions and progress across sessions with AI collaborators.
   - Decision: Adopted structured devlog format with three sections — open threads, decision log, work log.
   - Alternatives considered: Formal project management tools (too heavy), pure git log (loses narrative/intent).
   - Consequences: Each project maintains its own devlog. A top-level index links them.

* Work Log
** <2026-02-08> Session: Devlog scaffolding
   - Created devlog structure for MayaLucIA.
   - Next: Populate open threads from existing project documents.
